== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=What do I need to use Migrate Guru?=
You’ll need:
* An account on the new web hosting service.
* A domain on the new host, with WordPress installed.
* The destination’s FTP/cPanel details(optional).

=Why do you need my email?=
Migrate Guru requires an email address to send you updates on the migration process, notify you of any errors that occur during the migration.

=How long does Migrate Guru take to move a site?=
Migrate Guru can move a 1 GB (files & database) site in <30 Mins*
(*Approximate & depends on a number of factors).

=Are there any limitations on the number of migrations?=
Yes. We’ve enforced a limit of 5 site migrations/user/month (developers can request to have this limit extended). This cap ensures that our servers aren’t overburdened. Each of the 5 sites can be moved unlimited times.

=Does Migrate Guru backup my site?=
No.

=Do I need to have WordPress installed in the destination?=
Yes.

=Do I need to have Migrate Guru installed in the destination to transfer my site?=
Yes.

=Why do you need FTP/cPanel details?=
Migrate Guru requires FTP/cPanel details primarily as a fallback. The plugin generally doesn't need these details, relying instead on Migration-key based migration. However, in cases where this primary method encounters issues, the plugin uses FTP/cPanel details as an alternative to ensure a seamless migration.

=How do I move a multi-site network?=
When installed on a WordPress multi-site network, the plugin automatically becomes ‘network activated’. Once this is done you can go by the same steps as a single site.

=Do you have a help guide/documentation?=
Yes, we do. You can access it here: https://migrateguru.freshdesk.com/support/home
